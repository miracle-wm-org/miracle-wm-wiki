c1: float  # default: 1.2
c2: float  # default: 1.83
c3: float  # default: 2.2

```

## Default
```yaml
animations:
    - event: window_open
      type: grow
      function: ease_in_out_back
      duration: 0.25
    - event: window_move
      type: slide
      function: ease_in_out_back
      duration: 0.25
    - event: window_close
      type: shrink
      function: ease_out_back
      duration: 0.25
    - event: workspace_switch
      type: slide
      function: ease_out_sine
      duration: 0.175
```

## Example
```yaml
# ~/.config/miracle-wm/config.yaml

# Override the workspace switching animations such that it takes
# 1s and linearally interpolates to the target workspace
animations:
  - event: workspace_switch
    type: slide
    duration: 1
    function: linear
```
