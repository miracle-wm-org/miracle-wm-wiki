# split
The `split` command makes the current window a "split" container, meaning that
it can contain multiple windows. Depending on the layout of the split container,
new windows get places to the right of the current one ("splith") or below the
current one ("splitv").

## Syntax
```sh
split vertical|horizontal|toggle
```

## Example
```sh
miraclemsg split vertical
miraclemsg split horizontal
miraclemsg split toggle
```
