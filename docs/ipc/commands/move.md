# move
Finalized in v0.7.0, the `move` command allows users to move
containers and workspaces in a variety of ways.

## syntax
```sh
move window|container to mark <mark>  # Moves the container/window to the mark provided by <mark>, if any exists
move workspace to output left|right|down|up|current|primary|nonprimary|next|<output1> [output2]â€¦  # Moves the active workspace to another output
```

## Example
```sh
move container to mark meow     # Moves the focused container to mark "meow"
move workspace to output right  # Moves the current workspace to the output directly to the right of the active output
```
